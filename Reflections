Through this project, I gained insights into designing educational spaces and infrastructure to
support modern learning. I enhanced my understanding of scalable and secure networking solutions and
the considerations required for future-proofing technology infrastructure. The experience also helped me
improve my research and technical skills, particularly in areas like budgeting and subnetting.
